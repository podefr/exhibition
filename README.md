Exhibition.js
-------------

Create a gallery with your pictures and videos hosted on Flickr. Doesn't use any backend so you can host this gallery wherever you want.

Installation
------------

Just download the project, or git clone it, and place the content of the /public directory in the public area of your web server.

Then create a config.js file, based on example.config.js, and simply put your username and Flickr API key. You can get an API key for free here http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html

Enjoy!
